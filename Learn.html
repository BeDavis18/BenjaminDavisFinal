            <p>This assignment has been one that has definitely helped me to learn a lot. 
            During the course of this project, the videos from the class can only help you so much, and then there is a lot that we can find out from 
            our good friend <a href="http://www.google.com/" target="blank" title="google homepage">Google.</a>
            That being said, there is still a lot that I have left to learn, but I was able to learn a lot of the basics from this assignment. 
            </p>
            <p>Although, if you are thinking about taking the IS 201 class offered at Brigham Young University, I recommend that you do it for the following things that you will learn from the class:

                    <li>Automation of Excel</li>
                </ul>

                While this Tableau is neat and the videos are very helpful, there is one place that I got to learn all about how to do this.
                It was at this amazing campus with a beautiful backdrop.
                <br>
                <br>

                <img src="assets/img/BYU campus.jpg" height="400" alt="View from BYU campus of the Y">
                There truly is no other place where you can get this view, but also get an amazing education that is also spiritually uplifting as well. 
                I am grateful for the opportunity that I have to be a student here.
             </P> 
             <h3>Last Remarks!</h3>
            <p>
                However, there is something that Is worth even more acknowledgment, and that is the Savior. I am eternally grateful for my understanding of Him, and all that He does and did for all of mankind.
                Without Him, there wouldnt be a way back to our Father in Heaven, and through Him, we can receive forgiveness for the things that we have done that were against God's plan. In the preparation for the Christmas season,
                and also year long in general, might we remember to make Him apart of our lives and learn more of Him. 
                HE LIVES and HE LOVES YOU!
